Office and other applications performing digital signature
on Windows look for user certificates on the "My" system 
store of certificates. So, in order to make your CSP usable
for digital signature, you will first need to load the 
certificates managed by your CSP to the "MY" system store. 
This can be achieved using the function 
CertAddEncodedCertificateToStore followed by a call to 
CertSetCertificateContextProperty that will indicate your 
CSP name and the container where the key of certificate is stored.

To illustrate this, I have written a small command line program 
that enables loading all certificates managed by a given CSP to 
the "MY" certificate store. It is also enabled removing them from 
the store where they are no more needed.
You can get its source code from 
https://www.idrix.fr/Root/Samples/LoadCertToStore.cpp. A binary is 
also available at https://www.idrix.fr/Root/Samples/LoadCertToStore.zip 
(binary is signed using IDRIX code signing certificates).

I hope this will help.
